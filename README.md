# Oszi's Ansible Collections

Personal collections of Ansible roles and playbooks for Linux workstations and containers.  
Supported distributions are the latest stable Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu.  
See the examples and role defaults for basic documentation.

## Collections

* [oszi.environments](ansible_collections/oszi/environments) -
High-level environment roles.
* [oszi.general](ansible_collections/oszi/general) -
General, bite-sized, single-purpose roles.
* [oszi.thirdparty](ansible_collections/oszi/thirdparty) -
Software from third-party sources.

## First-time setup

**Install with ansible-galaxy from source:**

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install \
  "git+https://github.com/oszi/ansible-collections.git#/ansible_collections/oszi/" \
  -p ansible/collections
```

**Install as a git submodule:**

```bash
git submodule add "https://github.com/oszi/ansible-collections.git" ansible/collections
```

See the [examples](examples) for setting up an ansible inventory.

## Release policy

This repository uses lock-step semantic versioning with version pinning.  
Only the affected collections are updated in a release; minor versions may be skipped.  
Git tags are strictly incremental and contain all relevant release information.  
The collections are always installed from source; there is no Ansible Galaxy release.  
Obsolete backwards-compatibility support may be dropped at any time.
