# List of allowed ssh keys. Only keys present in this file are used
# in the SSH protocol. The ssh-add tool may add new entries to this
# file to enable them; you may also add them manually. A non-comment
# line starts with optional white spaces, followed by the keygrip of
# the key given as 40 hex digits, optionally followed by a caching
# TTL in seconds, and another optional field for arbitrary flags.
# Prepend the keygrip with an '!' mark to disable it.
