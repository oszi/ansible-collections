# Ansible Collection - oszi.general

Ansible collection for general, bite-sized, single-purpose roles.

* Use assets only from the distribution or contained within the role - with some exceptions.
* E.g. python, podman, flatpak and snap install third-party software **after** manual configuration.
* General playbooks serve a single-purpose and always target **all** hosts.
* See the roles' galaxy tags for corresponding environments.
